## Example `Create React App` wit Redux

### Packages installed
* `redux`: Main redux library
* `redux-thunk`: For dispatching asynchronous actions with redux
* `create-redux`: For using redux in a React app
* `react-router-dom`: Latest version of react-router that makes routing possible
* `lodash`: Utility library
* `bootstrap`, `font-awesome`: CSS libraries for styles and icons.

### Getting started
If you don't have yarn installed:

`npm i yarn -f`

Run `yarn install` then `yarn start`

`yarn` is a packaging system like `npm`, but it's much faster.

This project also supports [Redux Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en). A great tool to inspect and debug Redux Apps.
